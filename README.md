Project created by **zackdreaver** @2015

[ROenglishRE](https://rathena.org/board/topic/102689-ragnarok-english-translation-project/) is an unofficial english translation (Fan translation) project for Korea Ragnarok Online Renewal that focused on translating items, skills and textures.

Note: this project should be considered as educational purposes only, any commercial or illegal use by people or group aren't author's responsibilities.

## Prerequisites
* Full client of Korea Ragnarok Online
* 3rd party application for repacking **data** folder into GRF format. (eg: [GRF Editor](https://rathena.org/board/topic/77080-grf-grf-editor/))

## Text Editor and its settings
Most files here, including itemInfo.lua, were edited by using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
If you're not interested on translating, the default settings of NPP aren't suited for editing itemInfo.lua,
because there are 4 type of fonts that came from 4 main official servers (kRO, jRO, twRO and iRO) that could brake items' resource names.

Thus, you need to set up your NPP to:
1. Open Tab **Settings** > **Preferences** > **New Document**, then change **Encoding** to ANSI
2. Open Tab **Settings** > **Preferences** > **MISC.**, then DESELECT **Autodetect character encoding**

That way, when you open itemInfo.lua for the first time, it should look ![like this](https://i.ibb.co/wMH3Hyh/Sample1.jpg)

Other things, like choice of font or style, are up to you.
